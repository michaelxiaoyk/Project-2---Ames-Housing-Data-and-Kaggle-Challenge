    "# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Project 2! It's time to start modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model\n",
    "2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process\n",
    "3. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we are hosting a competition on Kaggle to give you the opportunity to practice the following skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refining models over time\n",
    "- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process\n",
    "- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, you will be submitting a technical report and a presentation. **You may find that the best model for Kaggle is not the best model to address your data science problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin working on this project, please do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign up for an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "2. **IMPORTANT**: Click this link ([Regression Challenge Sign Up](https://www.kaggle.com/t/cf68f4a276f44b59a3c6c843dbf9ed1e)) to **join** the competition (otherwise you will not be able to make submissions!)\n",
    "3. Review the material on the [DSI-US-6 Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge)\n",
    "4. Review the [data description](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Modeling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The train dataset has all of the columns that you will need to generate and refine your models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that you are trying to predict in your Regression model.\n",
    "2. Generate your regression model using the training data. We expect that within this process, you'll be making use of:\n",
    "    - train-test split\n",
    "    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters\n",
    "    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables\n",
    "    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)\n",
    "3. Predict the values for your target column in the test dataset and submit your predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.\n",
    "    - **Note**: Kaggle expects to see your submissions in a specific format. Check the challenge's page to make sure you are formatting your CSVs correctly!\n",
    "    - **You are limited to models you've learned in class**. In other words, you cannot use XGBoost, Neural Networks or any other advanced model for this project.\n",
    "4. Evaluate your models!\n",
    "    - consider your evaluation metrics\n",
    "    - consider your baseline score\n",
    "    - how can your model be used for inference?\n",
    "    - why do you believe your model will generalize to new data?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials must be submitted by the beginning of class on 7th June 2019 (Friday).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your technical report will be hosted on your Github.com. Make sure it includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A README.md (that isn't this file)\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook(s) with your analysis and models (renamed to describe your project)\n",
    "- At least one successful prediction submission on [DSI-US-6 Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge) --  you should see your name in the \"[Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge/leaderboard)\" tab.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric\n",
    "Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scores will be out of 27 points based on the 9 items in the rubric.** <br>\n",

    "# Ames Housing Project Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is not a linear process. In this project, in particular, you will likely find that EDA, data cleaning, and exploratory visualizations will constantly feed back into each other. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During basic EDA, you identify many missing values in a column/feature.\n",
    "2. You consult the data dictionary and use domain knowledge to decide _what_ is meant by this missing feature.\n",
    "3. You impute a reasonable value for the missing value.\n",
    "4. You plot the distribution of your feature.\n",
    "5. You realize what you imputed has negatively impacted your data quality.\n",
    "6. You cycle back, re-load your clean data, re-think your approach, and find a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you move on to your next feature. _There are dozens of features in this dataset._\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out programmatically concise and repeatable ways to clean and explore your data will save you a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline below does not necessarily cover every single thing that you will want to do in your project. You may choose to do some things in a slightly different order. Many students choose to work in a single notebook for this project. Others choose to separate sections out into separate notebooks. Check with your local instructor for their preference and further suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Visualizations\n",
    "- Look at distributions.\n",
    "- Look at correlations.\n",
    "- Look at relationships to target (scatter plots for continuous, box plots for categorical).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-processing\n",
    "- One-hot encode categorical variables.\n",
    "- Train/test split your data.\n",
    "- Scale your data.\n",
    "- Consider using automated feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "- **Establish your baseline score.**\n",
    "- Fit linear regression. Look at your coefficients. Are any of them wildly overblown?\n",
    "- Fit lasso/ridge/elastic net with default parameters.\n",
    "- Go back and remove features that might be causing issues in your models.\n",
    "- Tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **Identify a production model.** (This does not have to be your best performing Kaggle model, but rather the model that best answers your problem statement.)\n",
    "- Refine and interpret your production model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inferential Visualizations\n",
    "- Look at feature loadings.\n",
    "- Look at how accurate your predictions are.\n",
    "- Is there a pattern to your errors? Consider reworking your model to address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Recommendations\n",
    "- Which features appear to add the most value to a home?\n",
    "- Which features hurt the value of a home the most?\n",
    "- What are things that homeowners could improve in their homes to increase the value?\n",
    "- What neighborhoods seem like they might be a good investment?\n",
    "- Do you feel that this model will generalize to other cities? How could you revise your model to make it more universal OR what date would you need from another city to make a comparable model?\n",
